# Habit-Tracker
A Habit Tracker application for ADHD Workbench

A habit tracker is a table filled out by the user. On the vertical axis you have a list of dates for the month and a list of habits on the top horizontal axis. The intersection of row and column is a tick-box.

Throughout the day, a user ticks off habits as they complete them. The display of the habits being completed is visually encouraging. Some habits which are done multiple times per day may be counted with a  5 stroke system (although this may not be as important for digitally capturing the data).

Note: Many habits will be practiced every day, however goals of some habits may not be that habits are practiced every day, even though they may be asked daily. For example, a goal could be “Go to the gym at least three times per week” or “Read a chapter of a novel four times a fortnight” or “Visit Grandma twice a month”.
